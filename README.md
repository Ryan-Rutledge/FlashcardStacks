Virtual flashcard JavaScript library


##Synopsis

I developed this webpage as part of the [NARS web application](https://github.com/JGitHubApp/narsapp), before the project was discontinued. It's purpose was to help the students of the National Academy of Railroad Science (NARS) memorize different railraod signals and their meanings.

This project's goal is to convert the webpage into a general-purpose flashcard library.
