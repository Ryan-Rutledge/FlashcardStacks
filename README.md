Virtual flashcards for railroad signals


##Synopsis

I developed this webpage as part of the [NARS web application](https://github.com/JGitHubApp/narsapp), before the project was discontinued. It's purpose was to help the students of the National Academy of Railroad Science (NARS) memorize different railraod signals and their meanings.

My goal with this project now is to convert it into a general-purpose flashcard application.
